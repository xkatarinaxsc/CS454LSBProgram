#Installation
Firstly assuming you have already unzipped the file with this project in it,
move the project into your desired directory. From here open your terminal in Pycharm 
or, if using command prompt, command prompt from the directory and change your 
working directory to the project's root folder. 

To run the project from the Git Bash terminal, navigate to the src folder and open git bash
then use the command "python main.py"
